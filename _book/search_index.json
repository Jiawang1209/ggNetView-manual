These interactions collectively shape the functioning of biological and ecological systems. Despite its broad adoption, existing tools often face limitations in flexibility, customization, reproducibility, and the generation of publication-ready figures. To address these challenges, ggNetView was developed as an R package that integrates ggplot2, ggraph, and tidygraph within the Grammar of Graphics framework, enabling fully reproducible and highly customizable network visualizations. The package provides deterministic layout algorithms, comprehensive topological analyses, modular coloring schemes, hierarchical annotations, and consistent theming, ensuring standardized and interpretable graphical output. Although initially designed for applications in soil science and microbial ecology, ggNetView is broadly applicable to network analyses in molecular biology, including WGCNA and protein–protein interaction (PPI) networks. By lowering technical barriers in network construction and visualization, ggNetView enables researchers across disciplines to efficiently produce reproducible, publication-quality network figures. 1.2 Installation First, install the required dependencies # install.packages(&quot;BiocManager&quot;) BiocManager::install(&quot;WGCNA&quot;) # install.packages(&quot;remotes&quot;) remotes::install_github(&quot;alserglab/mascarade&quot;) remotes::install_github(&quot;zdk123/SpiecEasi&quot;) and then install ggNetView. # install.packages(&quot;devtools&quot;) devtools::install_github(&quot;Jiawang1209/ggNetView&quot;) # install.packages(&quot;pak&quot;) pak::pak(&quot;Jiawang1209/ggNetView&quot;) 1.3 Citation If you use ggNetView in your research, please cite: Yue Liu, Chao Wang (2025). ggNetView: An R package for complex biological and ecological network analysis and visualization.
